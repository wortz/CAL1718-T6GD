Design and Analysis of Algorithms 2018, first project and second project .

Theme 6: Supermarket at home
A supermarket chain wants to innovate and allows its customers to shop for supermarket purchases over the Internet, and then they are delivered to the customer's home. To monetize the service, the supermarket tries to group the largest number of purchases in a single trip by distributing purchases to customers at their respective addresses. 
Develop a system that allows the supermarket to evaluate different home delivery strategies. Lorries will all be able to leave a single supermarket, or there may be several supermarkets maintaining their own delivery vehicle, trying to group customers closest to a given branch.

Evaluate graph connectivity to prevent customers from being served by supermarkets for which there will be no possible itinerary. In addition to trying to minimize the itinerary of distribution of purchases, it is also intended to make the largest number of deliveries in a single trip, on the condition that they have all purchases to be delivered on the same day they were made.

Consider using real maps extracted from OpenStreetMaps (www.openstreetmap.org), locating the supermarket chain branches and the addresses of their customers on the map.
